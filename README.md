# sABR_Builder
- A collection of scripts and resources for building your own speech ABR experiment. 
- This repository further includes finished and ready-to-use experiment resources for recording speech ABRs. 
- All template files and procedures employ soft-trigger approaches, which means that all sweeps have the same trigger code attached to them.
- In case you want to employ paradigms that include alternating conditions such as the one of Bidelman (2015), you will need to reassign triggers using a manually created numeric vector. I am planning to upload instructions for this procedure sometime soon.
